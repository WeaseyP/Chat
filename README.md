# Chat
C++ Chat Application

#Instruction:
Currently in development this will be updated as the application is updated.

Currently to run the application you need three terminals open. And in the first one run:
g++ server.cpp -o server
g++ client.cpp -o client

./server

And on the other two run:
./client

You can now send messages between the clients.
